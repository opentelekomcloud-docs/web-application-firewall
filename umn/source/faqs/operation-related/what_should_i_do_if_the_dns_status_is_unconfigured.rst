What Should I Do If the DNS Status Is Unconfigured?
===================================================

If **DNS** is **Unconfigured**, domain name resolution fails, that is, the domain name is not connected to WAF. In this case, perform the following steps to connect the domain name again:

-  If a proxy such as CDN or AAD is used, you need to configure the back-to-source IP address, subdomain name, and TXT record. :ref:`Figure 1 <waf_01_0056__en-us_topic_0000001221245779_fig450482413592>` shows an example.

   #. Configure the back-to-source IP address of the proxy on the website.

      For example, change the back-to-source IP address of CDN or AAD to the WAF IP address by following the instructions shown in :ref:`Figure 1 <waf_01_0056__en-us_topic_0000001221245779_fig450482413592>`.

   #. Configure **Subdomain Name** and **TXT Record**.

      Add a subdomain name and TXT record to the DNS records of your DNS provider by following the instructions shown in :ref:`Figure 1 <waf_01_0056__en-us_topic_0000001221245779_fig450482413592>`.

      The high availability of our system, which is based on multi-AZ deployments to support both active-active and disaster recovery, relies on the WAF CNAME record.

-  If no proxy is used, the CNAME record must be configured. :ref:`Figure 2 <waf_01_0056__en-us_topic_0000001221245779_fig84741317702>` shows an example.

   #. Go to your DNS provider and configure the CNAME record. For details, contact your DNS provider.

      .. important::

         The high availability of our system, which is based on multi-AZ deployments to support both active-active and disaster recovery, relies on the WAF CNAME record. Therefore,

         a. Do not modify the hosts file. Add the CNAME record directly to the DNS records of your DNS provider.
         b. Do not use the A record to replace the CNAME record.

      The CNAME binding method of some common DNS providers is listed for your reference. If the following configuration is inconsistent with the actual configuration, rely on information provided by the DNS providers.

      a. Log in to the management console of the DNS provider.
      b. Go to the domain resolution record page.
      c. Set the CNAME resolution record.

         -  Set the record type to **CNAME**.
         -  Generally, enter the domain name prefix in the host record. For example, if the protected domain name is **admin.demo.com**, enter **admin** in the host record.
         -  The record value is the CNAME generated by WAF.
         -  Resolution line: keep the default value **TTL**.

      d. Click **Save**.

   #. Verify that the CNAME has been configured.

      a. In Windows, choose **Start** > **Run**. Then enter **cmd** and press **Enter**.

      b. Run the following command to query the CNAME. If the configured CNAME is displayed, the configuration is successful.

         **nslookup www.**\ *domain*\ **.com**
