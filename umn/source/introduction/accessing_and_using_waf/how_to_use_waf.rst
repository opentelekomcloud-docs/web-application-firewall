How to Use WAF
==============

The evolution of hacking techniques has caused frequent cybersecurity incidents against web servers. WAF provides comprehensive security protection for web services.

You can configure policies to detect attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, webshells, command and code injections, file inclusion, sensitive file access, third-party vulnerability exploits, CC attacks, malicious crawler scanning, and CSRF.

WAF features an easy-to-use console and provides event logs and statistics reports, helping you stay up to date with the security of your website and allowing you to mask false alarms or add whitelist rules to ignore false alarms.
